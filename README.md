# Abs-Rad-Timer
## this is a speedrun timer for absolute radiance in hollow knight

absolute radiance is the hardest boss in hollow knight, but after a while it becomes quite easy so trying to kill it as fast as possible is what players try to achieve
livesplit, the official speedrunning timer does not work for absolute radiance as there is no category for killing it in the [official speedrunning site](www.speedrun.com)

***this tool is not accurate, in fact there are multiple opinions on when the timer is supposed to start and stop, in this script it starts at the last frame of the "absolute radiance" text and stops at the first frame of the kill***
### the tool must not be stopped, or the window be switched right after the kill, as it uses the text after the kill as a reference

the time it took to get the kill is printed but most importantly stoped in the file "times.txt" to keep track of the progression
